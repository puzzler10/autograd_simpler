In this repo are jupyter notebooks used to create three blog posts on computational graphs ([one](https://tomroth.com.au/compgraph1/), [two](https://tomroth.com.au/compgraph2/) and [three](https://tomroth.com.au/compgraph3/)) and one [blog post on python decorators](https://tomroth.com.au/decorators/). See the notebooks starting with an underscore for these. The blog posts are the updated version of the notebooks: don't rely on code on the notebook or text to be up to date. 

Then there is a module called `numpy_autograd` that has an implementation of a computational graph. Backprop doesn't work and isn't supported at all at this stage. The `__init__.py` file converts the notebook in that folder to the script every time it is imported, which isn't the most efficient thing, but then again this isn't a productionised system.
